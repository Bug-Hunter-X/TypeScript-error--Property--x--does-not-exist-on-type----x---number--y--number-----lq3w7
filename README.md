This code demonstrates a common error in TypeScript when dealing with optional properties in object types.

The `printCoord` function expects an object with properties `x` and `y` of type number. However, the object passed to the function is missing the `x` property.

The TypeScript compiler will raise an error because it cannot guarantee that the `x` property will always exist.

This is an important example in illustrating the importance of type safety in TypeScript and how to handle optional properties correctly.
